          <span>Prince Vijaya (Sinhala:විජය කුමරු) was the first recorded King of Sri Lanka mentioned in the ancient Sri Lankan Pali chronicles. His reign is traditionally dated to 543 BC – 505 BC. The primary source for his life-story is the Mahavamsa.<br/><br/>rnrnThe Sri Lankan chronicle, the Mahavamsa written circa 400 CE by the monk Mahanama using the Dipavamsa and Sinhala Attakatha as sources, correlates well with Indian histories of the period. Lanka before colonization by Indian Prince Vijaya was earlier inhabited by the ancient tribes known as the Yakkhas and the Nagas. With the arrival of Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers  history of the Sinhalese started. Vijaya was eldest son of King Sinhabahu ("Man with Lion arms") and his Queen Sinhasivali of Bhurishrestha Kingdom.<br/><br/>rnrnVijaya married Kuveni (local Yaksha princess) like his army marrying off local women. Later this gave rise to the modern Sinhala race. Vijaya landed on Sri Lanka near Mahathitha (Manthota or Mannar), and named the island "Thambaparni" ('copper-colored palms). These are attested in Ptolemy's map of the ancient world. Mahavamsa also claims, Lord Buddha visiting Sri Lanka three times. Firstly, to stop a war between a Naga king and his son-in-law who were fighting over a ruby chair. It is said that on his last visit, he left his foot mark on Sripada (Adam's Peak). Tamirabharani was the old name for the second longest river in Sri Lanka (known as Malwatu Oya in Sinhala & Aruvi Aru in Tamil). This river was the main supply route connecting the capital, Anuradhapura to Mahathitha (Mannar). The waterway was used by Greek and Chinese ships traveling the southern Silk Route. Mahathitha was an ancient port linking Sri Lanka to Bengal and the Persian Gulf.rn</span>

        <span>Pandukabhaya (437 BC – 367 BC) was King of Upatissa Nuwara and the first monarch of the Anuradhapura Kingdom and 6th overall on the island of Sri Lanka since the arrival of Vijaya. He reigned from 437 BC to 367 BC. According to many historians and philosophers, he is the first truly Sri Lankan king since the Vijayan invasion, and also the king who ended the conflict between the Sinha clan and the local community, reorganizing the population. His story is one wrapped in myth and legend.<br/><br/>rnrnThere are three prevailing opinions on his origin.<br/><br/>rnrn<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">rn  <li> In the Mahavansa, his mother is Umaddha Citta, and his father is Digha Gamini, both of Aryan origin.</li>rn  <li> Kumarathunga Munidasa's opinion is that his father is Chittharaja.</li>rn  <li> Another not very popular theory claims he is from the Pandya Kingdom. Vijaya married into the Pandya royal family, and therefore Pandukabhaya or Pandu Kabhaya was a relative of Vijaya from the Pandya Kingdom.</li>rn</ul>rnrnThe second ruler of Sri Lanka was King Panduvasudeva, the nephew of Vijaya. Panduvasudeva married Baddha-Kacchayana, an extremely beautiful princess from India. The couple had ten sons, the eldest of whom was named Abhaya, and one daughter named Chitra.<br/><br/>rnrnWhen a sage prophesied that Chitra would bear a son who would kill nine of his uncles and claim the throne, nine of Chitra’s brothers told King Panduvasudeva to have her killed. However, Abhaya would not allow it, and Chitra was spared. She married a prince named Digha-Gamini (who, incidentally, was her cousin) and had a son, who was named Pandukabhaya.rn</span>

    <h1>Vasabha</h1>
    <div><img src="assets\article_images\vasabha.jpg" alt="Vasabha" /></div>
    <span>Vasabha (Sinhala: වසභ) was a monarch of the Anuradhapura period of Sri Lanka. He is considered to be the pioneer of the construction of large-scale irrigation works in Sri Lanka to support paddy cultivation. During his reign, 11 reservoirs and 12 canals were constructed. He also undertook the construction of several Buddhist temples and the renovation of existing ones. Vasabha's rise to power marked the beginning of a new dynasty of rulers, known as the First Lambakanna Dynasty after the name of his clan.<br/><br/>rnrnVasabha, born into the Lambakanna clan, spent his early years in a northern village, working for his uncle who was a general in the king's army. The ruler of the time, Subharaja, was informed by soothsayers that someone named Vasabha would overthrow him and become king. In an attempt to prevent this, Subharaja ordered the execution of anyone with that name. Vasabha's uncle tried to deceive him into the king's presence, but he was saved by Pottha, his uncle's wife, who revealed the king's intentions. Vasabha then went into hiding and secretly raised an army.<br/><br/>rnrnAfter assembling his forces, Vasabha initiated a rebellion against Subharaja, ultimately seizing the throne in 67 AD by killing both Subharaja and his uncle. His rule endured for 44 years until his death in 111 AD. Vasabha's legacy is defined by his introduction of large-scale irrigation works in the country, including the creation of eleven reservoirs and twelve canals. The most remarkable of his projects was the Alahara canal, which spanned around 30 miles and diverted water from the Amban river for agricultural use. Notable reservoirs attributed to Vasabha are Mahavilachchiya and Nochchipotana, each with a circumference of about 2 miles.<br/><br/>rnrnAs Vasabha received a prediction that he would live for only twelve more years, he devoted himself to Buddhism and performed meritorious deeds in hopes of prolonging his life. He constructed and renovated Buddhist temples, including the vatadage at Thuparama and additions to the Mahavihara.

  <h1>Gajabahu I</h1>
  <div><img src="assets\article_images\gajabahu1.jpg" alt="Gajabahu1" /></div>
  <span>Gajabahu I, also known as Gajabahuka Gamani (114 – 136 CE) was a Sinhalese king of Rajarata in Sri Lanka. He is renowned for his religious benefactions, extensive involvement in south Indian politics, and for possibly introducing the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The primary source for his reign is the Mahavamsa, though he is also the only early Sri Lankan king (along with Elara) to be extensively mentioned in the Chera Cilappatikaram (also spelled Silapathikaram).rnrn<br/><br/>rnrnNext to nothing is known about Gajabahu's youth, except that he was son of Vankanasika Tissa (reigned 110-113), king of Rajarata from Anuradhapura, and his consort Mahamatta. As such he must have witnessed the most dramatic event of Tissa's reign, the invasion of Rajarata by the Chola king Karikalan (it should be noted though that Karikalan's reign is dated by some historians as having occurred about 100 years after Gajabahu's). 12,000 Sinhalese people were seized to work as slaves on the banks of the Kaveri river and taken to India.rnrn<br/><br/>rnrnThe Mahavamsa mentions Gajabahu's accession and reign of twenty-two years, and mentions neither Karikalan's invasion, nor the military campaigns to south India that Gajabahu became famous for. Instead he is presented as a great patron of religion; the chronicle credits him with the construction of two viharas - Matuvihara and Rumika - and a stupa called Abhayuttara. He is also credited with making a mantle for Dutugemunu's Mirisavetiya, and for building a reservoir to provide the Abhayagiri monastery with food. He also made improvements to the four entranceways of the Abhayagiri stupa.rnrn<br/><br/>rnrnGajabahu is also credited with the introduction of the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The Silapathikaram mentions Gajabahu's presence at the consecration of a temple to Kannagi (identified as Pattini in this case) by the Chera king Senguvuttan. Returning from India he brought back not only the begging bowl of the Buddha but Pattini's sacred anklet, and constructed a temple to the goddess at a place called Vattapalli near Mullaitivu. However there is an alternative view that the cult actually arrived in Sri Lanka in the 13th century, and the legend of Gajabahu's patronage was retrospectively created to generate legitimacy for the goddess.rnrn<br/><br/>rnrnThe annual Perahara held in Kandy is also thought to have its roots in Gajabahu's reign. Following the successful completion of a campaign into Chola territories the temple of Vishnu in Anuradhapura is said to have staged a procession in thanks, which eventually developed into today's festival.rnrn<br/><br/>rnrnGajabahu was succeeded by his father-in-law Mahallaka Naga.</span>

The yuva raja was instrumental in eliminating the lawlessness prevailing in the country. The corrupt officials who suffered from this able administration gained the King Silamegha's ears by telling him that he was the king in name only while the administration of the country was by prince Aggabodhi (yuva raja).
