      <h1>Vijayabahu III</h1>
      <div><img src="assets\article_images\vijayabahu3.jpg" alt="Vijayabahu3" /></div>
      <span><h2>History</h2>rnA Pandyan usurper was ruling from Polonnaruwa and it was his third year on the island. The Sinhala monarchy was going through political instability. The Rajarata civilization that lasted for more than 15 centuries was on the verge of declining. It was during this time, that Magha from Kalinga invaded the island. As we had no strong king, things were easier for Magha. According to the continuation of the Great chronicle, known as the Culavamsa too, Magha’s army consisted of great soldiers of Kerala. This powerful and ruthless army started destroying the country after they landed on the island. Villages were raided and burnt. Temples were raided, and stupas were demolished. Monks, devotees, and even little children were killed brutally. Thousands of ola leaf books were destroyed. After Magha captured the Pandya usurper, the chronicle says that he gouged his eyes out. Such was the level of the ruthlessness of Magha’s iron rule. The Great chronicle says that he ruled for 21 years. However, there is a slight disagreement between historians about his exact time of rule and the years.<br/><br/>rn<h2>Rise of Vijayabahu III</h2>rnIt was during this time, a Kshatriya descendant of the Sri Sanghabodhi wansa, ruled all the Vanni kingdoms and became the king of Vanni. He rose into power and it is said that he secured the Maya rata from all enemies. He built his fortress on the summit of a pabbatha named Dambadeniya. He was crowned as the king of Sri Lanka at Dambadeniya. This is how the kingdom of Dambadeniya was established. The year of Vijayabahu III’s coronation is much debated, but what is generally accepted is the year 1232.<br/><br/>rn<h2>Who was he?</h2>rnAs the royalty or connection of Vijayabahu to a royal clan or family is not clear according to chronicles and inscriptions, there are disagreements between historians about his family. Some say that he is hailing from a royal clan of Anuradhapura. There are so many arguments about Vijayabahu’s ancestry. The royal dynasty established by him, later known as the Dambadeni Raja Wansha, ruled Sri Lanka for a long time. Therefore, writers who composed historical texts connected his family to ancient royalty. Professor Paranvaithana doubts these stories.<br/><br/>rnBecoming a Vanni-Raja is the most crucial achievement of Vijayabahu’s political journey. It is for the first time in Pali chronicles the term Vanni is being used. Although the history and origin of these Vanni rulers and kingdoms are still veiled, it is clear that during the doomed period of the 13th century, as the Rajarata civilization was declining, many regional rulers rose into power and they were called the Vanni kings. Vijayabahu was one of them, and through his valor and wisdom, rose into so much power, ending up establishing his dynasty as the next ruling dynasty of the Sinhala monarchy, and founding the third known Sinhala capital city (according to recorded history). His son, who was trained by him, defeated Magha and united the country.<br/><br/>rnSpending his youth in countless battles, Vijayabahu reached his old age when he was crowned as the king of Dambadeniya. He died after four years, in the year 1236. His son fulfilled his dream of a country free of enemies.<br/><br/>rn<h2>Savior of Buddha Sasana</h2>rnThe tooth relic and the Buddha’s begging bowl relic, which were considered symbols of power and royalty, were kept hidden in Kothmale during Magha’s time. Vijayabahu was successful in winning the trust and loyalty of the Buddhist bhikkhus. Therefore, the monks allowed the king to bring the two most sacred relics to a newly built temple of tooth. Having these two most sacred relics completed the power and authority of Vijayabahu as the king of Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>rnWinning the trust and loyalty of bhikkhus, made the people accept Vijayabahu as a savior of the Buddha Sasana, which he actually did. He restored many ancient monasteries and stupas, united the bhikkhus, and held a bhikkhu convention. He built a temple of the tooth relics in Beligala and more temples in Maya rata. His son Parakramabahu II restored the ruins at Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.</span>

      <div><img src="assets\article_images\parakramabahu2.jpg" alt="Parakramabahu2" /></div>
      <span><h2>Kalikala Sahitya Sarvagna Pandita</h2>rnrn<p>Parakramabahu II was a pioneer in literature and was bestowed with the honorary title "Kalikala Sahitya Sarvagna Pandita". His reign is notable for the creation of numerous Sinhalese literal works such as, Kausilumina, Pujavaliya, Pali Vishuddḥi Margaya, Thupavaṃsa and Sidhath Sangarava.</p>rnrn<h2>Early Life</h2>rnrn<p>Parakramabahu II was born in Sirivardhanapura to king Vijayabahu III of Dambadeniya. According to a popular legend, the day after his birth, his mother died and the king remarried a Muhammadan woman. Not long after, a son named Wattimi was born to the concubine.</p>rnrn<h2>Reign in Dambadeniya and Campaign against Magha</h2>rnrn<p>Parakramabahu's first act after his coronation was to build a Temple of the Tooth in his kingdom. At the ceremony of depositing the Tooth Relic of the Buddha, he promised to save the country from the cruel invader named Kalinga Magha.</p>rnrn<p>While preparing for the battle, the king had to face another invasion in his eleventh year (1247), by a Javaka or Malay ruler named Chandrabhanu from the Tambralinga kingdom of Southeast Asia. The reason Chandrabhanu invaded Sri Lanka is uncertain, but historians suggest that he invaded the politically fragmented island in the aim of claiming the relic of the Tooth of the Buddha. Although Chandrabhanu's initial invasion of the country wasn't a success, he settled in the North of Sri Lanka with an aim of re-invading the island.</p>rnrn<p>Parakramabahu II successfully pushed Kalinga Magha out of Polonnaruwa by 1244, and finally expelled him entirely from Sri Lanka in 1255, ending Magha's brutal 40-year rule. The fate of Magha after his banishment remains unknown.</p>rnrn<h2>Contributions to Sinhala literature</h2>rnrn<p>Parakramabahu II's reign is regarded as a golden age of Sinhalese literature, and Parakramabahu himself too was a patron in poetry and literature. He was popularly known as “KalikAla Sahitya Sarvagna Paṇḍitha” or “Panditha Parakramabahu”. The king's inspiration for Sinhalese culture is thought to have sparked during his childhood in the village.</p>rnrn<p>The government under Parakramabahu II gave full sponsorship to works of literature, and thus, several major literal works such as, Kausilumina, Pujavaliya, Pali Vishuddḥi Margaya, Thupavaṃsa and Sidhath Sangarava were published during the time.</p>rnrn<h2>Death</h2>rnrn<p>Having reigned for thirty-three years, King Parakramabahu II abdicated in favor of his son Vijayabahu IV in 1269 and died around a year later, in 1270.</p></span>

Although some historian say that the family was of Malayalee origin others say it originated in Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, India.They arrived in Sri Lanka around the 13th century and naturalized themselves in Sri Lanka.[3] One member of the family is noted for founding the current capital of Sri Lanka, Sri Jayewardenapura-Kotte as a fort from which he waged a war against encroaching tax collectors from the Jaffna Kingdom in the north. The family lost most of its influence after its leader Vira Alakeshwara was taken captive by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He in 1411.rn <br/><br/>rnThe first member of the family to arrive in Sri Lanka was named Nissanka Alagakonara, who migrated to Sri Lanka from a place called Vanchipura[6] or Kanchipuram[2] in India following Muslim invasions of his homeland Although the initially concentrated on mercantile activities and became wealthy, they eventually accrued political power with the local Gampola Kingdom by the 14th century.This was helped by their conversion to Buddhism following their arrival in the island.rn  <br/><br/>rnDuring the 1350‘s due to periodic invasions of the western region of Sri Lanka by the northern based Jaffna kingdom, many regions had begun to pay tribute and taxes to the Arya Chakaravarthi kings. The third member of the family to figure in historical accounts, known only as Alakesvara, was a minister of the local king Vickramabahu III fortified a marshy region around present day Colombo region, on the marshes to the south of the Kelani River.[8] He called the fortress Jayewardhanapura, and the area became known as Kotte, "The fort". By 1369 Alakesvara drove out the tax collectors and attacked the encampments of soldiers from Jaffna kingdom who attempted to invade the Sinhalese kingdoms at Chilaw and Negombo killing a large number of them and forcing the rest to retreat. The Arya Chakaravarthi launched a second invasion attempt during the reign of Buwanekabahu V, landing in the southern kingdom by land and sea. Although the king initially fled his capital, his army defeated the force that approached along the ground in Matale. Alakeshwara simultaneously attacked the troops that arrived by sea, routing them at Dematagoda, and destroying their ships at Panadura.rn  <br/><br/>rnAlthough most Sinhalese sources mention that he was able to defeat the invaders, there is a conflicting epigraph by the Kings of Jaffna known as the Kotagama inscription detailing how the King of Jaffna had prevailed.rn  <br/><br/>rnSubsequently local sources are clear that he began to be viewed as a credible leader and overshadowed the actual king and came to be considered as the real power.rn  <br/><br/>rnAfter Alakeswara’s death, established as between 1382 and 1392, there was disunity in his family with family members fighting each other for power and procession. Kumara Alakesvara, half-brother of king Buwanekabahu Vcontrolled the region from 1386–87 and was followed by Vira Alakesvara from 1387 onwards until 1391, when he was ousted by the rival claimants relative. He came back to power with the help of foreign mercenaries in 1399. He ruled until 1411 when he confronted the visiting Chinese Admiral Zheng He resulting in a war. Zheng captured and took to him to China, returning him to the country a year later. However the humiliation suffered due to this incident, and the decades of infighting within the family, greatly diminished its political power.rn</span>

      <h1>Vijayaba Kollaya</h1>
      <div><img src="assets\article_images\vijayabakollaya.jpg" alt="VijayabaKollaya" /></div>
      <span>The rich tapestry of human history is adorned with countless tales of conquest, upheaval, and cultural evolution. Among these narratives, the Vijayaba Kollaya stands as an enthralling and significant episode in the history of Sri Lanka, revealing a complex interplay of power, identity, and socio-political dynamics. The term "Vijayaba Kollaya" itself translates to "The Revolt of Vijayaba," encapsulating a pivotal moment that shaped the trajectory of the island nation. In this essay, we delve into the historical significance of the Vijayaba Kollaya, exploring its origins, motivations, and enduring implications.rnrn<br/><br/>rnThe roots of the Vijayaba Kollaya extend back to the 16th century, during a time of European colonial expansion and domination. The Portuguese, in particular, had established a formidable presence in the Indian Ocean region, seeking to consolidate their control over trade routes and influence local powers. Sri Lanka, with its strategic location and abundant resources, naturally became a target for Portuguese ambitions. The Kandyan Kingdom, situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, resisted these foreign incursions, marking the beginning of a protracted struggle for sovereignty.rnrn<br/><br/>rnAt the heart of the Vijayaba Kollaya was King Mayadunne of Sitawaka, a formidable leader who spearheaded the resistance against Portuguese encroachment. Mayadunne's fierce determination to protect the cultural and political integrity of his kingdom inspired the rallying cry for the Kollaya. The term "Vijayaba" is believed to refer to Mayadunne himself, emphasizing his role as a leader of the rebellion. The Kollaya was not merely a military endeavor; it symbolized a resolute commitment to preserving Sri Lanka's heritage and autonomy.rnrn<br/><br/>rnMotivations behind the Vijayaba Kollaya were multi-faceted. Firstly, it was a reaction to the perceived threat of cultural assimilation. The Portuguese, driven by their religious zeal, sought to convert the local populace to Christianity, eroding traditional beliefs and practices in the process. This cultural imposition served as a rallying point for the Kollaya, uniting diverse factions in their shared desire to safeguard their way of life. Additionally, the Kollaya represented a response to economic exploitation. The Portuguese monopoly over trade routes and resources had deleterious effects on the local economy, further galvanizing resistance efforts.rnrn<br/><br/>rnThe Vijayaba Kollaya was characterized by a series of battles and diplomatic maneuvers that showcased the resilience of the Kandyan Kingdom. Notably, the siege of Colombo in 1564 marked a significant turning point, as the Kandyans, under the leadership of Mayadunne's successor, King Rajasinha I, managed to gain control of the fortified Portuguese stronghold. This victory emboldened the Kollaya movement and revealed the vulnerability of the seemingly invincible European invaders.rnrn<br/><br/>rnHowever, the Kollaya was not without its challenges. The Portuguese countered with military force and diplomatic strategies, attempting to weaken the resolve of the Kandyans. The protracted conflict led to shifting alliances and allegiances, highlighting the intricate balance of power within the region. Yet, the Kollaya persisted, encapsulating the spirit of resistance that refused to be extinguished.rnrn<br/><br/>rnThe legacy of the Vijayaba Kollaya reverberates through the annals of Sri Lankan history. While the Kandyans were ultimately unable to completely expel the Portuguese, the resistance efforts laid the groundwork for future developments. The Kollaya served as an inspiration for subsequent generations, fostering a sense of national identity and pride that transcended regional divides. It also underscored the importance of unity and collaboration in the face of external threats, a lesson that resonates in contemporary times.rnrn<br/><br/>rnIn conclusion, the Vijayaba Kollaya is a chapter of Sri Lankan history that remains etched in the collective memory of the nation. It represents a valiant struggle against foreign domination, driven by a fervent desire to preserve cultural heritage, economic autonomy, and political sovereignty. The legacy of the Kollaya serves as a reminder of the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity and the significance of preserving one's identity in a rapidly changing world. As Sri Lanka continues to navigate its path through the currents of time, the Vijayaba Kollaya stands as a testament to the power of determination and the indomitable will to shape one's destiny.rn</span>

      <h1>Rajasinghe I</h1>
      <div><img src="assets\article_images\rajasinghe1.jpg" alt="Rajasinghe1" /></div>
      <span>House of Siri Sanga Bo | Sitawaka - (1581 - 1593)rn <br/><br/>rnrnRajasinghe I (Sinhala:පළමුවන රාජසිංහ) [1] was a king of the Kingdom of Sitawaka. He is known for his extreme bravery and patriotism. Born as Tikiri Bandara to King Mayadunne of the Kingdom of Sitawaka, the name "Rajasinha" was given to him after a fierce battle against Portuguese forces. Rajasinha means the King of Lions (or the Lion King).rn  <br/><br/>rnGenerally, it has been recorded that he reigned from 1581 to 1592. However, according to De Queros, Mayadunne handed over the kingdom to Rajasinha in 1578. In 1581, Mayadunne died leaving Rajasinha to ascend the throne.[2] There are conflicting information in various sources regarding his role in his father Mayadunne's death. In the 4th chapter of Mahawamsa written by Thibbotuwawe Buddharakhitha thero during the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy states that Rajsinha killed Mayadunne. Minor Rajawaliya also recorded that due to his patricidal act which was considered as an irreversible "anantharya" karma by Buddhist monks, conflicts arose between him and the Buddhist prelates and as a result he followed an anti-Buddhist line. However, critics believe that the non-recording of a patricidal event in important sources such as Rajawaliya and Alakeshwara war renders the fact that he killed his father suspicious and conflicting. Rebairo too does not record a patricidal event. Dutch envoy Spillburjon who visited Sengkadagala kingdom reported that the rumor of patricide was spreading only in the Kandyan kingdom. Queros is known for his antipathy towards Sitawaka Rajasinha. In this background, if he committed patricide, Queros would have reported it without fail. In his lengthy account, Queros reported that Mayadunne died of natural causes after having lived 85 years. According to him, Rajasinha returned to seethawaka from the famous siege of the Colombo fort on hearing the passing away of his father.rn  <br/><br/>rnWhile his main battle was against the Portuguese forces in defense of the sovereignty of the Sinhala monarch, he had to battle with numerous internal forces—some regional and individual, supported directly and indirectly by forces from Portugal.rn  <br/><br/>rnOne such adventure of Tikiri Bandara was the battle against his brother-in law " Veediye Bandara". Mayadunne initiated the campaign to destroy Veediye Bandara primarily due to (1) the ill treatment meted out to Mayadunne's daughter Tikiri Kumari who was the wife of Veediye Bandara and (2) non-rendering of the support to Mayadunne to wage war against the Kandyan ruler. Combined Sitawaka and Portuguese troops attacked Veediye Bandara's fort at Pelenda chasing him down to Devundara and capturing Tikiri Kumari.Sitwaka troops were led by twelve year old Tikiri Bandara.Veediye Bandara re grouped with the troops of the Kandyan leader and reached Salpiti Korale to attack Sitawaka troops. He was defeated by Tikiri Bandara again. He fled to Kanda uda rata and returned to Alut Nuwara with troops of the kandyan king. After a fierce battle at Alutnuwara, Veediye Bandara was decisively defeated by Tikiri Bandara.According to the "Alakeshwara War", this battle was so fierce and legendary, following which Tikiri Bandara was called "Rajasinha" .Rajawaliya states that the title Rajasinha that implies " Lion who is the king of kings" was given to him following this famous battle.rn  <br/><br/>rnWhile Rajasinghe waged his war against Portuguese, King Karaliyadde Bandara, utilized Portuguese soldiers to protect his Kandyan kingdom. Infuriated by this relationship with Portuguese invaders, with the support of Weerasundera Mudali of Peradeniya , Rajasinha led his troops up to the entry point at Balana in 1583 and chased Karalyadde Bandara.[4]rn  <br/><br/>rnThe battle with the Portuguese in Mulleriyawa was the bloodiest fought to date. While the Portuguese held guns and more advanced weapons, the Sinhalese army simply equipped with swords and their ancient fighting method called Angam Pora, defeated the entire Portuguese army. Accounts indicate[citation needed] the vast paddy field in Mulleriyawa turned red with the blood of the dead Portuguese soldiers. This was the greatest defeat an European army ever had in an Asian land. It still remains that way. According to Queros, though he solicited support of Malabar coast or Kerala troops, non-availability of a naval fleet affected his endeavors to cleanse the country from invaders despite his remarkable siege at Colombo Fort.rn  <br/><br/>rnKing Rajasinghe I appointed a South Indian, named Aritta Kivendu as his chief advisor and acted on his advice. He was awarded the title Mannamperuma Mohottala. King Rajasinha arranged the marriage of Mannamperuma Mohottala to a sister of a junior queen known as "iron daughter" He converted to Hinduism.[6] He was reported to have settled Brahmans at significant Buddhist sites such as sigiriya, sri pada etc. Under the advice of Mannamperuma Mohottala, he razed many Buddhist religious sites to the ground. The discontent caused among Buddhist public and prelates was a major reason for the downfall of the kingdom. Annexation of the Kandyan kingdom and killing many royals also believed to have contributed to the decline. His cruel approach towards Buddhism ignited anti-government rebellions with the involvement of Buddhist prelates. This gave rise to his conflict situation with the Buddhist prelates. In the Sath korale region , a prince named Pothupala Bandara rebelled against Rajasinha with the support of Portuguese. The rebellion was suppressed and all leaders who supported the rebellion were be headed. according to the Manadarampura Puwatha, prelates were involved in an attempt to make Konappu Bandara the king of Kandy. This conspiracy was exposed leading to execution of hundreds of Buddhist prelates. Mandaram pura puwatha reported that in one place , 121 monks were killed by Rajasinha. One of the notable victims was the chief prelate of Sitawaka. Support of the maha sangha that was a pillar of strength for Mayadunne and Tikiri Bandara to mobilize the public support for the sitawaka kingdom rapidly eroded.rn  <br/><br/>rnKonappu Bandara having returned to Kandy via Mannar, Sri Lanka started a rebellion in Kandy. First he defeated the troops led by general and Aritta Kiwnendu. Secondly , Konappu Bandara defeated troops led by King Rajasinha himself. Rajawaliya reported that he withdrew saying that there was no king in front of me who fought valiantly from 11 years of age. However, this person who wages war in Kandy has lots of merits and I have now lost my merits. on his return from the defeat at Balana, he died in March 1592. The reason for his death was a wound caused by a pointed bamboo segment at Pethangoda while returning to sitawaka. Rajawaliya further recorded that the death was a result of the curse (suniyam) imposed on him by the Dodampe Ganithaya. Alakeshwara war reported that he was cremated at Mahanuwara that means the then capital Sitawaka.rn</span>

      <h1>Aritta Keevendu</h1>
      <div><img src="assets\article_images\arittakeevendu.jpg" alt="ArittaKeevendu" /></div>
      <span>In the annals of history, tales of cunning advisors and manipulative power struggles often emerge, showcasing the intricate web of intrigue that weaves through the corridors of power. One such figure who left an indelible mark on the history of Cetauca is Aritta Keevundu, also known as Manampere Meh Mohotala. Aritta Keevundu's rise to prominence and his role in shaping the destiny of the Cetaucan court during a time of crisis provide a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of power and manipulation.<br/><br/>rnrnThe year was 1592, a period marked by political turmoil and military conflicts. King Rajeshing, the esteemed ruler of Cetauca's lineage, met his demise due to an infected injury sustained during a retreat from a disastrous military defeat at the hands of the King of Candy. Tragedy struck as King Rajeshing left behind no male heir to claim the throne of Cetauca, plunging the court into a state of uncertainty and disarray. It was during these tumultuous times that Aritta Keevundu, a Hindu advisor of King Rajeshing, seized the opportunity to make his mark on history.<br/><br/>rnrnAritta Keevundu, later adopting the alias Manampere Meh Mohotala, recognized the power vacuum that had emerged in the wake of King Rajeshing's demise. With an astute understanding of the political landscape, Aritta maneuvered his way into a position of authority, positioning himself as the guiding force behind the scenes. By aligning his interests with those of the court and displaying his expertise in statecraft, Aritta effectively garnered the support and trust of the courtiers.<br/><br/>rnrnWith the throne vacant, Aritta Keevundu orchestrated a calculated move to solidify his control over the court. He crowned Rajasuria, one of King Rajeshing's grandsons, as a puppet king of Cetauca. This move allowed Aritta to exert a substantial influence over the young monarch, manipulating decisions and policies to further his own agendas. Aritta's strategic manipulation of power dynamics was not merely confined to political matters; he also established himself as an influential figure in the socio-cultural landscape, using his knowledge and connections to sway public opinion.<br/><br/>rnrnHowever, Aritta Keevundu's ascent to power was not without its own share of challenges and conspiracies. As the puppet king, Rajasuria was little more than a pawn in Aritta's intricate game. Recognizing the potential threat posed by the king's presence, Aritta engaged in a sinister plot to eliminate Rajasuria. Teaming up with Mahabisa Pandhara, one of King Rajeshing's sisters, Aritta orchestrated the assassination of Rajasuria. This nefarious act allowed Aritta to consolidate his control even further, as he once again handpicked a replacement puppet to dance to his tune.<br/><br/>rnrnNikhipitiya Bandara, Mahabisa Pandhara's own son, now ascended the throne as Aritta's chosen puppet. This succession further solidified Aritta's influence over the court, as he skillfully manipulated Nikhipitiya Bandara to serve his interests. The courtiers and subjects, though perhaps unaware of the extent of Aritta's machinations, found themselves living under a ruler who was nothing more than a figurehead for Aritta's ambitions.<br/><br/>rnrnThe tale of Aritta Keevundu's reign behind the throne of Cetauca illustrates the art of manipulation, cunning, and the lengths to which individuals can go to acquire and retain power. Aritta's ability to exploit power vacuums, manipulate emotions, and orchestrate elaborate conspiracies showcases his mastery of the game of politics. His actions remind us of the delicate balance between loyalty and personal ambition, where those closest to power can often become the most dangerous adversaries.<br/><br/>rnrnIn conclusion, Aritta Keevundu's rise to power and subsequent reign as the puppet master behind Cetauca's throne is a gripping tale of manipulation, intrigue, and power struggles. His adeptness at navigating the complex labyrinth of politics allowed him to not only secure his own position but also shape the course of history for an entire kingdom. Aritta Keevundu's legacy serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the enduring allure of power and the moral dilemmas that can arise when personal ambition collides with the greater good.<br/><br/>rn</span>
