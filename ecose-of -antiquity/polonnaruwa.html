      <h1>Vijayabahu I</h1>
      <div><img src="assets\article_images\vijayabahu1.jpg" alt="Vijayabahu1" /></div>
      <span><b>Vijayabahu I</b>, originally known as <b>Prince Kitti</b>, reigned from <b>1055 to 1110</b> as a significant medieval monarch in the history of Sri Lanka. Emerging from a lineage of royalty, he came of age during a tumultuous era when a portion of the land was under the control of invaders from the Chola Kingdom of Tamilakam. Assuming control over the Ruhuna principality in the southern region of the nation in 1055, he embarked on a determined campaign spanning seventeen years. This endeavor culminated in the successful expulsion of the Chola forces from the island in 1070, a remarkable achievement that led to the reunification of the country after more than a century of division. Within the span of his rule, <b>Vijayabahu I</b> not only reinstated Buddhism as a prominent cultural and spiritual force in Sri Lanka but also undertook extensive efforts to rehabilitate the infrastructure that had suffered considerable damage during the preceding conflicts.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Birth and Early Life</h2><br>rnBorn around 1039, under the name <b>Kitti</b>, <b>Vijayabahu's</b> origins trace back to the Ruhuna principality situated in the southern expanse of the country. His parentage linked him to <b>King Moggallana</b>, a reigning figure in Ruhuna, and <b>Queen Lokitha</b>. This period saw Sri Lanka grappling under the dominion of Chola intruders hailing from South India. However, amidst this turmoil, Ruhuna remained under the governance of Sinhala monarchs who steadfastly resisted Chola supremacy. At a mere fifteen years of age, <b>Kitti</b> managed to vanquish the last of these defiant rulers, <b>Lokissara</b>, with an unwavering aspiration to ascend to the throne of Ruhuna. This resolute triumph positioned him as the ruler of Ruhuna in 1055, and he embraced the appellation <b>'Vijayabahu'</b> to mark this significant milestone.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Vijayabahu's Struggle Against Chola Rule</h2><br>rn<b>Vijayabahu's</b> forces in Ruhuna faced persistent incursions by the Chola army, their attacks unrelenting. Yet, through his strategic prowess, he orchestrated the liberation of Ruhuna from Chola dominion by 1058, definitively wresting control. With Ruhuna secured, his sights were set on the conquest of Polonnaruwa, the paramount capital of the land. Initiating his offensive in 1066, he executed the inaugural assault on Polonnaruwa, successfully seizing and holding the city momentarily. Regrettably, the tide shifted when reinforced Chola troops arrived from South India, empowering their army significantly. This resurgence culminated in a renewed Chola offensive, prompting <b>Vijayabahu's</b> tactical withdrawal from the city's confines.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Services</h2><br>rn<b>Vijayabahu</b> also built roads and resting places for pilgrims heading to Sri Pada. He granted villages and land for pilgrims' service.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Death</h2><br>rnHe passed away in 1110 after ruling Sri Lanka for 55 years. Known as "<b>Mahalu Vijayabahu</b>" or "<b>Vijayabahu the old</b>," his legacy lives on,rn</span>

        <h1>Parakramabahu I</h1>
        <div><img src="assets\article_images\parakramabahu1.jpg" alt="Parakramabahu1" /></div>
        <span><h2>Birth</h2>rnAt the time of Parakramabahu's birth, a man named Manabharana ruled Dakkhinadesa. He didn't have sons but had two daughters. He felt disappointed by their inability to continue his royal line and worried about being defeated by Vikrama Bahu.<br>rnMeanwhile, Manabharana's younger brother, Sri Vallabha, and his wife Sugala had a son and challenged Manabharana's rule. Manabharana stepped down and let his ministers handle things.<br>rnParakramabahu's birth was predicted in a dream by his father, King Manabharana. His mother Ratnavali gave birth to him, and he was named Parakramabahu. He was likely born around 1123 in the capital of Dakkhinadesa, Punkhagama.<br>rnVikramabahu I, ruling in Polonnaruwa, wanted to make Parakramabahu his heir. But Manabharana rejected the offer, fearing conflict. Sadly, Manabharana fell ill and died soon after Parakramabahu's birth.<br>rnManabharana's younger brother, Kitti Sri Megha, took over Dakkhinadesa's throne, and Sri Vallabha became the sole ruler of Ruhuna. Parakramabahu, his mother Ratnavali, and his sisters were sent to live under Sri Vallabha's care in the capital of Ruhuna, Mahanagahula.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Early Life and Influential Connections</h2>rnWhile still young, Parakramabahu's sister Mitta was forcibly married to their cousin, Manabharana, against the wishes of their mother, Queen Ratnavali. Ratnavali preferred her daughters to marry into the Kalinga clan, their own royal lineage. Parakramabahu met his future queen consort, Lilavati, during his time at Sri Vallabha's court. She later became a ruler in her own right.<br>rnIn 1132, after Vikramabahu's death, his son Gajabahu II became the ruler of Rajarata. Sri Vallabha and Kitti Sri Megha, from the Arya royal family, attempted to seize Rajarata by force but failed.<br>rnParakramabahu, feeling impatient with his minor state, left Sri Vallabha's palace in Ruhuna and returned to Dakkhinadesa. There, he lived with his uncle because Sri Vallabha planned to make Manabharana the ruler of Rajarata, which threatened Parakramabahu's position. In Dakkhinadesa, Parakramabahu found a welcoming environment under Kitti Sri Megha, who didn't have sons and effectively adopted Parakramabahu.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Bold Moves and Political Maneuvers</h2>rnAfter reaching adulthood, Parakramabahu secretly left Dakkhinadesa and headed to Rajarata, Gajabahu II's realm. He gathered allies at Badalattha (now Batalagoda) and met Sankha, a military leader on the border between Rajarata and Dakkhinadesa. Parakramabahu killed Sankha when he tried to report the prince's journey to Kitti Sri Megha. Parakramabahu seized Buddhagama and Sankha's belongings before continuing on his journey. He avoided Kitti Sri Megha's pursuing force and journeyed through the Malaya region to reach Gajabahu's court.<br>rnThe reason behind Kitti Sri Megha's attempts to bring Parakramabahu back to Dakkhinadesa was supposedly concern for his nephew's well-being and the fear that Parakramabahu might reignite conflict between the Arya and Kalinga factions. However, it's believed that the portrayal of their relationship as "tenderly attached" was fictional, and their accounts don't align with harmonious uncle-nephew relations.<br>rnDuring his time with Gajabahu, Parakramabahu engaged in significant actions. He orchestrated a web of espionage around Gajabahu's court and arranged the marriage of one of his sisters, Bhaddavati, to Gajabahu. Through this union, he gained Gajabahu's trust and managed matters involving the royal family. Despite this, he kept Bhaddavati's dowry for himself. Parakramabahu also secretly negotiated with Gokanna, Gajabahu's general. However, Gajabahu became suspicious of Parakramabahu's activities. Aware of this, Parakramabahu left Rajarata by night and returned to Dakkhinadesa.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Religious Reforms and Political Triumphs</h2>rnDuring King Vatta Gamini Abhaya's rule (104 BCE, 88–76 BCE), the sangha, or monastic community, had split into three competing orders: Mahavihara, Abhayagiri vihāra, and Dakkhina vihara. Parakramabahu aimed to reunite these groups, reminiscent of the time of Dutugamunu. The sangha had suffered corruption, with monks marrying and behaving more like worldly individuals.<br>rnAround 1165, a Theravada council convened in Polonnaruwa to reform the sangha. Parakramabahu's main advocate for this effort was Mahathera Kassapa, a knowledgeable monk in Tipiṭaka and Vinaya. This endeavor encountered resistance, particularly from the Abhayagiri sect that followed advanced Mahayana practices. Many monks left the country to escape religious intolerance, and some returned to lay life. Parakramabahu may have encouraged this, believing in the "purification" of the priesthood through the exclusion of the minority.<br>rnParakramabahu held annual meetings with the sangha leaders, possibly to track their progress and standards, focusing on a ritual by the Mahaweli river. After suppressing rebellions in Ruhuna in 1157, he recovered the Tooth relic and alms bowls, placing them in the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Polonnaruwa. Parakramabahu's reign was marked by significant constructions for the reformed sangha, detailed in the Culavamsa. His accomplishments are also inscribed, such as at the Gal Vihara. Hinayana Buddhism saw a revival during his time.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Construction</h2>rnParakramabahu's reign left an indelible mark on Sri Lanka's history through his extensive construction endeavors. His influence is evident in many remnants in Polonnaruwa, western, and south-eastern Sri Lanka. His first projects included restoring Anuradhapura, revitalizing Thuparamaya, Mihintale, and Ruwanwelisaya.<br><br>rnrnParakramabahu, having set aside his role in Dakkhinadesa's Parakramapura, focused on Polonnaruwa. Due to frequent sieges, the city had deteriorated to a mere name. Consequently, little remains of pre-12th century Polonnaruwarntoday. He divided the city into four districts, each with its own alms-giving house for clergy, equipped with various provisions. Parakramabahu constructed hospitals and enhanced the city's defense by expanding its walls, complete with turrets and fourteen gates. He also built or refurbished smaller townships outside the city, along with lush gardens featuring ponds, such as the enduring Twin Pools.<br><br>rnrnSignificant constructions of his reign include the Gal Vihare, the Polonnaruwa Vatedage, and temples like Lankatilaka and Jetavanaramaya. He expanded and beautified the royal palace in Polonnaruwa, creating splendid audience halls and bathing ponds.<br><br>rnrnParakramabahu continued his hydraulic works, renovating reservoirs and canals damaged during the Chola invasion. He constructed the immense Parakrama Samudra reservoir spanning 2,400 hectares. His inscribed works can be found in places like Maha Vewa, Padaviya Vewa, and Panda Vewa. The cost of these projects weighed heavily on the people and the treasury, leading to taxation and feudal obligations. The toll on the populace can be seen in the decline of larger gold coins toward the end of his reign.<br><br>rnrn<h2>Legacy and Succession</h2>rnThe Culavamsa mentions that Parakramabahu "ruled for thirty-three years" and passed away in Polonnaruwa. His exact burial place remains a mystery. His successor was Vijayabahu II of Polonnaruwa, referred to as his "sister's son." Parakramabahu had summoned Vijayabahu II from Sinhapura, the capital of Kalinga, to take over the throne. Under Vijayabahu II's reign, the amicable relations between Polonnaruwa and Rāmmana were reestablished, marking a continuation of Parakramabahu's diplomatic efforts.rn</span>

            <h1>Kalinga Magha</h1>
            <div><img src="assets\article_images\kalingamagha.jpg" alt="KalingaMagha" /></div>
            <span>Kalinga Magha, also known as Magha the Tyrant, is remembered for his forceful conquests and unwavering Hindu zeal during his reign from 1215 to 1236. He is recognized as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom and the first ruler of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. Originally a prince hailing from the Kingdom of Kalinga, situated in modern-day Orissa, India, his family held ties to the rulers of Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu. Notably, Kalinga Magha's relatives from Ramanathapuram oversaw the renowned Rameswaram temple.[1]<br/><br/>rnrnIn 1215, Kalinga Magha seized the throne from Parakrama Pandyan of Polonnaruwa, marking a significant turning point. His reign prompted a large-scale exodus of native Sinhalese to the southern and western regions of Sri Lanka, as well as the mountainous interior, as an attempt to evade his authority. Magha's dominion marked the end of Sinhalese influence in the northern heartland of the island, Rajarata, effectively causing the subsequent realms to be established primarily in the southern reaches.<br/><br/>rnrnKalinga Magha's arrival in 1215 AD at Karainagar, accompanied by a formidable army of around 24,000 soldiers predominantly drawn from Chola and Pandyan territories, signaled his intent. He established his troops in Karainagar and Vallipuram, gaining control over the Jaffna principality. Subsequently, he marched on to Polonnaruwa, where he vanquished Parakramabahu and asserted his rule for the next 21 years. However, his expulsion from Polonnaruwa in 1236 led him to retreat to Jaffna, which he governed until 1255.<br/><br/>rnrnDuring this phase, the locus of native power in Ceylon began shifting southward. Within Magha's rule, the chief priests of Pulatthinagara safeguarded two sacred relics of Rajarata, namely the Buddha's alms bowl and the revered Tooth Relic. These treasures were conscientiously concealed on the mountain Kotthumala in a secure region, an action that prevented their return to the northern territories.<br/><br/>rnrnThe resistance against the invaders began to coalesce around strategically positioned towns and fortresses situated within Ceylon's rugged hinterlands. Yapahuwa, a fortress founded by General Subha, and Gangadoni, established by General Sankha, emerged as key bastions. From these strongholds, the nobles successfully thwarted Magha's advances, protecting the districts and the Order of Buddhist monks.<br/><br/>rnrnEventually, Vijayabahu III emerged as the prominent figurehead of the resistance. Chronicles indicate he descended from Sirisamghabodhi, a Rajarata king from a few generations prior, potentially through marriage. He evaded Magha's forces for an extended period within the inaccessible forests. In the 1220s, he expelled the Tamil and Kalinga forces from Mayarata and established his capital in Jambudhoni (Dambadeniya). Notably, Vijayabahu's significant achievement involved recovering the two sacred relics around 1222. He showcased these relics across his territories and enshrined them within a newly erected temple.<br/><br/>rnrnVijayabahu's reign centered on reconstructing the fragmented Buddhist infrastructure in Mayarata, with many of his religious initiatives enduring into modern times. Periodic raids were launched into Kalinga-controlled territories, but it wasn't until his son, Parakramabahu II (1234-1267), that a concerted effort was made to expel the invaders.<br/><br/>rnrnUpon his ascension, Parakramabahu II embarked on subduing the enemy forces in Lanka through his regal authority and benevolent spirit. Curiously, Magha's involvement in these wars is not mentioned in historical records, suggesting his potential demise or deposition. Instead, the chronicles highlight two Damila kings, Mahinda and Jayabahu, who established strongholds in Polonnaruwa. Both were eventually defeated by the resurgent forces of Dambadeniya. Magha's fate remains shrouded in mystery as he does not reappear in subsequent historical accounts.rn</span>
