          <span>Prince Vijaya (Sinhala:විජය කුමරු) was the first recorded King of Sri Lanka mentioned in the ancient Sri Lankan Pali chronicles. His reign is traditionally dated to 543 BC – 505 BC. The primary source for his life-story is the Mahavamsa.<br/><br/>  The Sri Lankan chronicle, the Mahavamsa written circa 400 CE by the monk Mahanama using the Dipavamsa and Sinhala Attakatha as sources, correlates well with Indian histories of the period. Lanka before colonization by Indian Prince Vijaya was earlier inhabited by the ancient tribes known as the Yakkhas and the Nagas. With the arrival of Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers  history of the Sinhalese started. Vijaya was eldest son of King Sinhabahu ("Man with Lion arms") and his Queen Sinhasivali of Bhurishrestha Kingdom.<br/><br/>  Vijaya married Kuveni (local Yaksha princess) like his army marrying off local women. Later this gave rise to the mode  Sinhala race. Vijaya landed on Sri Lanka near Mahathitha (Manthota or Mannar), and named the island "Thambapa i" ('copper-colored palms). These are attested in Ptolemy's map of the ancient world. Mahavamsa also claims, Lord Buddha visiting Sri Lanka three times. Firstly, to stop a war between a Naga king and his son-in-law who were fighting over a ruby chair. It is said that on his last visit, he left his foot mark on Sripada (Adam's Peak). Tamirabharani was the old name for the second longest river in Sri Lanka (known as Malwatu Oya in Sinhala & Aruvi Aru in Tamil). This river was the main supply route connecting the capital, Anuradhapura to Mahathitha (Mannar). The waterway was used by Greek and Chinese ships traveling the southe  Silk Route. Mahathitha was an ancient port linking Sri Lanka to Bengal and the Persian Gulf. </span>

        <span>Pandukabhaya (437 BC – 367 BC) was King of Upatissa Nuwara and the first monarch of the Anuradhapura Kingdom and 6th overall on the island of Sri Lanka since the arrival of Vijaya. He reigned from 437 BC to 367 BC. According to many historians and philosophers, he is the first truly Sri Lankan king since the Vijayan invasion, and also the king who ended the conflict between the Sinha clan and the local community, reorganizing the population. His story is one wrapped in myth and legend.<br/><br/>  There are three prevailing opinions on his origin.<br/><br/>  <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">   <li> In the Mahavansa, his mother is Umaddha Citta, and his father is Digha Gamini, both of Aryan origin.</li>   <li> Kumarathunga Munidasa's opinion is that his father is Chittharaja.</li>   <li> Another not very popular theory claims he is from the Pandya Kingdom. Vijaya married into the Pandya royal family, and therefore Pandukabhaya or Pandu Kabhaya was a relative of Vijaya from the Pandya Kingdom.</li> </ul>  The second ruler of Sri Lanka was King Panduvasudeva, the nephew of Vijaya. Panduvasudeva married Baddha-Kacchayana, an extremely beautiful princess from India. The couple had ten sons, the eldest of whom was named Abhaya, and one daughter named Chitra.<br/><br/>  When a sage prophesied that Chitra would bear a son who would kill nine of his uncles and claim the throne, nine of Chitra’s brothers told King Panduvasudeva to have her killed. However, Abhaya would not allow it, and Chitra was spared. She married a prince named Digha-Gamini (who, incidentally, was her cousin) and had a son, who was named Pandukabhaya. </span>

        <span>King Dutugemunu, also known as Duttha Gamini Abhaya, is one of the most revered and influential monarchs in the history of Sri Lanka. Bo  in 161 BCE, he emerged as a valiant and visionary leader who played a pivotal role in shaping the island's destiny. Renowned for his bravery, leadership, and unwavering dedication to his people, Dutugemunu's reign marked a significant chapter in Sri Lanka's history, transforming the nation and leaving an indelible legacy that still resonates today. <br/><br/> Dutugemunu was bo  to King KavanTissa and Queen Vihara Maha Devi in the kingdom of Ruhuna, located in present-day southe  Sri Lanka. Legend has it that even as a child, he displayed remarkable strength and intelligence. As he grew older, his desire to unify the divided island under a single rule intensified. <br/><br/> At the time, Sri Lanka was fragmented into numerous warring kingdoms, with the dominant power being the Chola Empire of South India. Dutugemunu, with the support of his loyal followers, embarked on a mission to liberate the island from foreign dominance and unite it under his rule. <br/><br/> Dutugemunu's most famous military campaign was against the Chola King Elara, whose forces controlled the northe  regions of Sri Lanka.

He was a visionary ruler who dedicated himself to the welfare of his people and the development of the nation. He embarked on ambitious construction projects, building magnificent stupas, irrigation reservoirs, and Buddhist monasteries throughout the country. <br/><br/> The Ruwanwelisaya, a colossal stupa constructed in the sacred city of Anuradhapura, stands as a testament to Dutugemunu's devotion to Buddhism. It remains one of the most revered Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka and a symbol of national pride. <br/><br/> King Dutugemunu's reign had a profound impact on Sri Lanka's history and culture.

      <div><img src="assets\article_images\valagamba.jpg" alt="Valagamba" /></div>
      <span>Vattagamini Abhaya, also known as Valagamba, was crowned as King of
Anuradhapura in 103BC. His reign would be a turbulent one. Five months
into his rule, a rebellion broke out in Ruhuna, led by a Brahmin named
Tissa. At the same time, a Dravidian army led by seven Dravidian generals
landed in Sri Lanka. In response, Valagamba formed an alliance with Tissa
as they both wished to drive out the invaders. Tissa attempted to fight
the Dravidians on his own, but was swiftly defeated. The Dravidians then
marched on Anuradhapura, but were met by Valagamba’s own army at
Kolambalaka. On a day of blood and steel, the two armies clashed, and
King Valagamba was defeated. He was forced to flee into exile,
abandoning the Anuradhapura Kingdom to the Dravidians.
Once the dust had settled, two of the Dravidians returned to India, taking
the sacred Tooth relic and Alms Bowl of the Buddha with them. The five
Dravidians who were left settled down to rule their captured territory.
They made the great city of Anuradhapura their capital, and secured
their rule over the entire region.
The first of the Dravidians was Pulahatta, a Pandyan chieftain. He made
himself King of Anuradhapura and made his fellow general Bhatiya his
Chief Minister. Bhatiya, however, killed Pulahatta after three years and
took the throne for himself. He ruled for two years until his own Prime
Minister, Panya Mara, assassinated him and replaced him as king.
Regicide now having become a popular pastime, the fourth Dravidian,
Pilaya Mara, killed Panya Mara and assumed power. But his reign was
short, and he was murdered just seven months later by the last of the
five invaders, Dathika. Dathika became king in the year 90BC and ruled
Anuradhapura for two years. With his treacherous comrades now dead,
all seemed to be going well for him. But this safety was an illusion.
Everything fell apart in 88BC, when he received reports that the deposed

King Valagamba had mustered an army whilst in hiding and was now
marching towards the city of Anuradhapura.
Dathika fought Valagamba’s new army at Anuradhapura, but this time it
was the exiled king who triumphed, defeating Dathika and reclaiming his
throne after fourteen years in hiding. King Valagamba recovered the
Tooth and Alms Bowl Relics from India and greatly improved the country
by many means. He would rule Sri Lanka until his death in 77BC, and he
would go down in history as one of the greatest monarchs ever to rule
Sri lanka

      <span>King Kutakanna Tissa, a prominent ruler of the 1st century BC, left an indelible
mark on the history of Anuradhapura, with his reign spanning from 42 BC to
20 BC. He ascended to the throne after Queen Anula and passed on his legacy
to his son, Bhatikabhaya Abhaya. His reign was marked by significant
accomplishments, including infrastructural developments and the initiation
of transformative projects.

One of the pivotal moments during King Kutakanna Tissa's rule was the
demise of Queen Anula. Records suggest that King Kutakanna Tissa was
involved in the events leading to Queen Anula's death. This incident marked
a significant turning point in the power dynamics of the time, allowing King
Kutakanna Tissa to ascend the throne.

King Kutakanna Tissa's reign was characterized by numerous architectural
marvels that transformed the landscape of Anuradhapura. Among his notable
accomplishments were the construction of the Thelagama Viharaya, Warnaka
Brook, Ambadugga Tank, and Bhayoduppala Tank. These projects not only
showcased his commitment to infrastructure but also played a pivotal role in
enhancing the city's water management and agricultural capabilities.

King Kutakanna Tissa's reign was also marked by his efforts to fortify the city
of Anuradhapura. He undertook the ambitious task of constructing a
protective wall around the city. This wall not only served as a defensive
structure but also demonstrated the king's dedication to ensuring the safety
and security of his subjects.

One of King Kutakanna Tissa's most ingenious projects was the construction
of a conduit over the city wall. This conduit showcased his innovative thinking
and engineering prowess. It likely played a vital role in the distribution of
water throughout the city, supporting its growing population and various
activities.

One of the crowning achievements of King Kutakanna Tissa's reign was the
creation of Padmaswara Park. This park stood as a testament to the king's
appreciation for nature and leisure. Its design and development reflected his
commitment to providing his subjects with spaces for recreation and
relaxation.

King Kutakanna Tissa's reign was marked by a blend of strategic political
maneuvers, architectural innovation, and infrastructure development. His
visionary leadership left an enduring legacy that continues to shape the
historical and cultural narrative of Anuradhapura. His achievements not only
contributed to the city's prosperity during his rule but also laid the foundation
for subsequent developments in the region.</span>

    <span>Vasabha (Sinhala: වසභ) was a monarch of the Anuradhapura period of Sri Lanka. He is considered to be the pioneer of the construction of large-scale irrigation works in Sri Lanka to support paddy cultivation. During his reign, 11 reservoirs and 12 canals were constructed. He also undertook the construction of several Buddhist temples and the renovation of existing ones. Vasabha's rise to power marked the beginning of a new dynasty of rulers, known as the First Lambakanna Dynasty after the name of his clan.<br/><br/>  Vasabha, bo  into the Lambakanna clan, spent his early years in a northe  village, working for his uncle who was a general in the king's army. The ruler of the time, Subharaja, was informed by soothsayers that someone named Vasabha would overthrow him and become king. In an attempt to prevent this, Subharaja ordered the execution of anyone with that name. Vasabha's uncle tried to deceive him into the king's presence, but he was saved by Pottha, his uncle's wife, who revealed the king's intentions. Vasabha then went into hiding and secretly raised an army.<br/><br/>  After assembling his forces, Vasabha initiated a rebellion against Subharaja, ultimately seizing the throne in 67 AD by killing both Subharaja and his uncle. His rule endured for 44 years until his death in 111 AD. Vasabha's legacy is defined by his introduction of large-scale irrigation works in the country, including the creation of eleven reservoirs and twelve canals. The most remarkable of his projects was the Alahara canal, which spanned around 30 miles and diverted water from the Amban river for agricultural use. Notable reservoirs attributed to Vasabha are Mahavilachchiya and Nochchipotana, each with a circumference of about 2 miles.<br/><br/>  As Vasabha received a prediction that he would live for only twelve more years, he devoted himself to Buddhism and performed meritorious deeds in hopes of prolonging his life. He constructed and renovated Buddhist temples, including the vatadage at Thuparama and additions to the Mahavihara.

  <h1>Gajabahu I</h1>
  <div><img src="assets\article_images\gajabahu1.jpg" alt="Gajabahu1" /></div>
  <span>Gajabahu I, also known as Gajabahuka Gamani (114 – 136 CE) was a Sinhalese king of Rajarata in Sri Lanka. He is renowned for his religious benefactions, extensive involvement in south Indian politics, and for possibly introducing the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The primary source for his reign is the Mahavamsa, though he is also the only early Sri Lankan king (along with Elara) to be extensively mentioned in the Chera Cilappatikaram (also spelled Silapathikaram).  <br/><br/>  Next to nothing is known about Gajabahu's youth, except that he was son of Vankanasika Tissa (reigned 110-113), king of Rajarata from Anuradhapura, and his consort Mahamatta. As such he must have witnessed the most dramatic event of Tissa's reign, the invasion of Rajarata by the Chola king Karikalan (it should be noted though that Karikalan's reign is dated by some historians as having occurred about 100 years after Gajabahu's). 12,000 Sinhalese people were seized to work as slaves on the banks of the Kaveri river and taken to India.  <br/><br/>  The Mahavamsa mentions Gajabahu's accession and reign of twenty-two years, and mentions neither Karikalan's invasion, nor the military campaigns to south India that Gajabahu became famous for. Instead he is presented as a great patron of religion; the chronicle credits him with the construction of two viharas - Matuvihara and Rumika - and a stupa called Abhayuttara. He is also credited with making a mantle for Dutugemunu's Mirisavetiya, and for building a reservoir to provide the Abhayagiri monastery with food. He also made improvements to the four entranceways of the Abhayagiri stupa.  <br/><br/>  Gajabahu is also credited with the introduction of the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The Silapathikaram mentions Gajabahu's presence at the consecration of a temple to Kannagi (identified as Pattini in this case) by the Chera king Senguvuttan. Retu ing from India he brought back not only the begging bowl of the Buddha but Pattini's sacred anklet, and constructed a temple to the goddess at a place called Vattapalli near Mullaitivu. However there is an alte ative view that the cult actually arrived in Sri Lanka in the 13th century, and the legend of Gajabahu's patronage was retrospectively created to generate legitimacy for the goddess.  <br/><br/>  The annual Perahara held in Kandy is also thought to have its roots in Gajabahu's reign. Following the successful completion of a campaign into Chola territories the temple of Vishnu in Anuradhapura is said to have staged a procession in thanks, which eventually developed into today's festival.  <br/><br/>  Gajabahu was succeeded by his father-in-law Mahallaka Naga.</span>

  <span>King Kasyapa, also known as Kasyapa I, was a significant figure in the ancient history of Sri Lanka. Bo  in the 5th century CE, Kasyapa ruled as the king of Sigiriya, a kingdom located in the central part of the island. His reign, though short-lived, left an indelible mark on the country's history and culture. King Kasyapa's ambitious architectural endeavors and his tumultuous reign have made him a subject of intrigue and fascination for historians and archaeologists alike. This article delves into the life, achievements, and controversies surrounding the enigmatic monarch. <br/><br/> Kasyapa was the son of King Dhatusena, who ruled the kingdom of Anuradhapura, one of the most prominent ancient cities in Sri Lanka. Despite being the eldest son, Kasyapa was not the heir to the throne, which led to resentment and a strained relationship with his father. Fearing his half-brother Mogallana would succeed him, Kasyapa staged a coup, overthrowing and imprisoning Dhatusena. <br/><br/> To legitimize his rule, Kasyapa constructed a grand palace atop Sigiriya, a massive rock fortress in central Sri Lanka. The Sigiriya Rock Fortress, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, was ado ed with intricate frescoes, elaborate gardens, and an innovative water management system. These remarkable feats of engineering demonstrated Kasyapa's vision and ambition. <br/><br/> Kasyapa's reign was marked by both grandeur and controversy. He transformed Sigiriya into a thriving capital city, attracting scholars, artists, and traders from far and wide. His court was renowned for its patronage of the arts, resulting in a vibrant cultural scene that flourished during his rule. However, Kasyapa's actions were not without controversy. <br/><br/> One of the most debated aspects of King Kasyapa's reign is his relationship with his half-brother Mogallana. Fearing retribution, Kasyapa fortified Sigiriya, creating an impregnable fortress to protect himself from Mogallana's potential revenge. This led to a prolonged power struggle, culminating in the decisive Battle of Vijithapura. <br/><br/> Despite the defensive advantages offered by Sigiriya, Kasyapa's forces were ultimately defeated by Mogallana's army, and the king met a tragic end. Some historical accounts suggest that Kasyapa took his own life upon realizing defeat, while others claim that he died in battle. Nevertheless, Kasyapa's legacy lived on, both in the ruins of Sigiriya and in the historical records of Sri Lanka. <br/><br/> The Sigiriya Rock Fortress, with its impressive architecture and artistic marvels, stands as a testament to Kasyapa's grand vision and ambition. The elaborate frescoes that ado  the rock walls depict celestial maidens and provide invaluable insights into the artistic practices of the time. These paintings, despite their partial destruction, continue to captivate visitors and serve as a reminder of the artistic achievements of the ancient Sri Lankan civilization. <br/><br/> Furthermore, Kasyapa's rule had a lasting impact on the socio- political landscape of Sri Lanka.

  <h1>Udaya IV</h1>
  <div><img src="assets\article_images\udaya4.jpg" alt="Udaya4" /></div>
  <span>The annals of Sri Lankan history are marked by a rich
tapestry of kings, dynasties, and the ebb and flow of
power. In the 10th century, during a period of political
turbulence and external threats, King Udaya IV ascended
to the throne of Anuradhapura, embarking on a reign
filled with challenges, intrigue, and ultimately, the
intrusion of the Chola dynasty. In this essay, we will delve
into the life and times of King Udaya IV, exploring the
socio-political landscape of ancient Ceylon and the Chola
invasions that left an indelible mark on the island's
history.

Udaya IV, whose reign spanned from 945 to 953 AD, was
the successor of Sena III, and it is believed that he might
have been a close associate or even a younger brother of
his predecessor. His ascension to the throne marked a
period of transition and uncertainty for the Kingdom of
Anuradhapura. With the weight of expectation on his
shoulders, Udaya IV faced numerous challenges during
his eight-year rule.

One of the most significant events during Udaya IV's reign
was the invasion by the Chola dynasty, a powerful empire
in South India. The Cholas, under the leadership of King
Parantaka I, sought to assert their dominance over the
island, possibly driven by geopolitical interests and the
desire to control lucrative trade routes. The pretext for
their invasion was the regalia left by Maravarman
Rajasinha II, the Pandyan king, with King Dappula IV
during an earlier visit.

However, when the Cholas demanded the return of the
regalia from King Udaya IV, he steadfastly refused. This
act of defiance set the stage for a military confrontation
between the Cholas and the Kingdom of Anuradhapura.
The Chola king dispatched his army to invade Sri Lanka,
leading to a tumultuous period in the island's history.

Faced with the impending Chola invasion, King Udaya IV
made a strategic decision to flee to the region of Ruhuna,
seeking refuge from the oncoming storm. The Chola
forces descended upon Anuradhapura, pillaging and
plundering the city. The once-mighty capital of
Anuradhapura was laid to waste, and the Cholas returned
to India with their spoils.

The invasion marked a significant turning point in the
history of the Kingdom of Anuradhapura. The Cholas'
incursion exposed the vulnerabilities of the island's
defenses and highlighted the need for a robust military
infrastructure to deter future threats. The devastation
wrought upon Anuradhapura led to a period of instability
and fragmentation, with regional rulers vying for control
in the wake of the Chola invasion.

While King Udaya IV's flight to Ruhuna might have saved
his life, it did not shield him from the profound
implications of the Chola invasion. His reign had been
marked by resistance against external aggression, but
the cost was the ruination of his kingdom's capital and the
upheaval of his people's lives.

It is important to note that King Udaya IV was not merely
a passive victim of these tumultuous events. He exhibited
courage and determination in his refusal to relinquish the
Pandyan regalia, which symbolized not only the Cholas'
covetous ambitions but also his unwavering commitment
to the sovereignty of his kingdom. His decision to flee to
Ruhuna, though prompted by necessity, was a strategic
move that allowed him to survive the immediate threat
and potentially regroup for the future.

While King Udaya IV's reign is predominantly remembered
for the Chola invasion, it is also worth mentioning some
of his other contributions. Like many Sri Lankan
monarchs of the time, he was involved in religious
activities, including the construction of the Manipāsāda.
Unfortunately, due to the chaotic circumstances of his
reign, he was unable to complete this architectural
marvel.

The Chola invasion and its aftermath would have a lasting
impact on the political landscape of Sri Lanka. The
disarray left in the wake of the invasion set the stage for
further instability and conflicts. It was only in subsequent
years, with the rise of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom and the
establishment of a more centralized rule, that Sri Lanka
would regain its footing.

In the annals of Sri Lankan history, King Udaya IV's reign
serves as a reminder of the challenges and complexities
faced by the island's rulers during a turbulent era. His
refusal to yield to external pressures and his
determination to protect the regalia of the Pandyan king
reflect the resilience of the Sri Lankan people in the face
of adversity. Although his reign was marred by the Chola
invasion and the resulting upheaval, it is important to

recognize the role he played in safeguarding his
kingdom's interests.

In conclusion, King Udaya IV's reign was a pivotal moment
in the history of Anuradhapura, marked by both resilience
and adversity. His refusal to surrender the Pandyan
regalia to the Cholas demonstrated his commitment to
preserving the sovereignty of his kingdom. While the
Chola invasion brought devastation to Anuradhapura, it
also set the stage for future developments in Sri Lankan
history. King Udaya IV's legacy, though tarnished by the
invasion, serves as a testament to the complex and often
tumultuous nature of politics and power in ancient Sri
Lank</span>
